Auction Site :
	Once the auction site receives the player entry, it is supposed put out a message in the 
	chat box saying this is the player we are going to bid...
	Based price is x Crores .. starts the auction... which shud enable the players to be able to send the bids..
	To make sure no two bids are same, we will just give them a button which says +x amount, 
	incremental value based on the auction rules...
	All the players will be able to see the team/user who now has the bid, and the amount he is quoting...
	
	
Player DB :

Name -
Country -
type - bat,bowl,all,wk, etc
auction category - bat, Bo Allrounder, Ba Allrounder, Wk, Marquee
category - uncappped/ capped indian / foreign etc
summary - few lines about him... auctioneer will first read the summary ... then the base price ...
status - sold/unsold
base price - 
current bid price - 
team name- 


The team DB can be entirely extracted from player DB ... But if there are any contraints, then we can add team DB also ..
If there are same data at multiple places, it might be difficult to maintain all of them.. better to have a single Player DB,
and extract the team from that ...updating is easier...extraction might take some computation i.e. filtering players based on team name

Following data need to be filtered out based on the teams : 
Team Members list with price : [array of player names and corresponding price]
Total Purse Spent
No of wk, No of bat, No of bowl, No All rounder - to check if squad is adhering to conditions
