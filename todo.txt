### TO-DO ####

To add support for 
1) Multiple groups ( 16) with multiple users(4-5) in each of those. Make suitable design changes for their login and registration as well.
2) Intra-group chat
3) Increase the player database. Currently only 5. Get data and add.
4) Improving auction scheduling functionality
	Currently the auction starts when all the users join. We need to make the server consider time as a parameter.

Post-Auction stuff :
5) Buying from Unsold list.
6) Support player transfers after auctions.
7) Replacing injured player with new player during the games.

##### Code Cleanups #####

1. Modules in server.js
2. UI code clean up
3. Modularising player data access ( player.js )
	All the access ( get/set ) on player data will be done only through APIs exposed via player.js
	Currently, getAllPlayers returns the entire players list. Instead, we should make suitable changes to
	improve seperation of concern and segregation of duties.
	
	APIs : ( self explanatory from the names itself )
	1) getPlayerForAuction()
		Returns a players name ( who is yet to be auctioned).
	2) getUnsoldPlayersForAuction()
		This will return a unsold player names in the auction i.e. who was auctioned and unsold.
	3) getPlayerAttribute(name,attribute)
		Returns the attribute value of the player ( name )
		Example : getPlayerAttribute('yuvraj','current price') should return his current price.
	4) setPlayerAttribute(name,attribute,value)
		Sets the value to the attribute of the player ( name )
		Example : setPlayerAttribute('yuvraj','current price',1000) should set the yuvraj's current price as 1000.
	5) getPlayerListByAttribute(attribute,value)
		Get a list of players who's attributes are 'value'. 
		Example : getPlayerListByAttribute('country','India') should return all Indian players in the list
